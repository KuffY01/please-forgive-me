        <p>
          No matter what, I will always try to give you the best version of myself. Please don't get tired of me, because I always want to go through many good/bad days with you so that we can survive. This is me with my best version along with all my shortcomings to decorate it.

          I'm sorry for making you tired during this relationship with me and I also want to say thank you all this time for your never-ending patience, even though my character and attitude often make you dizzy or even tired hehe.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know it must be really hard for you :')) thank you for still holding on and putting up with me. I just want to be with you, to have a happy life with you, to take care of you. The 3 days we were together I still acted like a shitty person but I did take care of you and that's all I am asking you know how I was when we were together for those days and same way I'll keep myself when we are together. I'll be even better than before. I'm not able to express my feelings like this and I know this doesn't justify the way I act It is never my intention to make you cry or sad or to make you feel suffocated. The only thing I want for you is to be happy is to be mine is to be happy with me and haev a life with me. :))
        </p>
        <p>
          Just give me one last chance and I swear you'll never have anything else to complain about. I'll take care of evrything I'll fix everything I'll make it all good again. I'll listen to you and support you in anything you tell me I'll be the kind of person you want me to be no more excuses no more saying that Im doing it its just taking time nothing I'll do it and I'll make oyu feel happy again like oyu used ot feel when you met me for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>

Consider every I am sorry a sit up I'll take it as my punishment if you tell me to do it on call I'll even do it on call just plase talk to me don't punish me like this I can't styay without you like this it feels empty and bad and just not right at all.
        </p>

         I don't know, I can't explain it in more detail, sorry, I know, sometimes I'm not the best in your eyes. I'm just still a burden on my parents and other shit
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know whether I'll be able to do it or not if you leave me hehe. There's nothing I can be proud of about myself, let alone my family:'))

          I'm sorry, I'm too selfish, I often get angry at you and sometimes I ignore you just because I'm jealous and misunderstand. We often fight, I don't know why now, I get emotional, so I get jealous easily because of small things. Maybe my love for you is too much.

        <p>
          I know you're so tired of hearing me apologize, but I told you something, right? it's better to apologize than to lose you, you are my world.
        </p>
        <p>My world is small and quiet too, because the only inhabitant is you, I hope you understand some of the things I said above, I also want us to continue to be good, I love you, I really love you, nothing has changed about me, I always love you. , you are my favorite person</p>

        <h2>Now you forgive me?</h2>
